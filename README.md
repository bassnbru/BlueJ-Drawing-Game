# BlueJ-Drawing-Game
Wanted to mess with BlueJ's graphics drawing and mouse inputs so i put the two together to make a drawing tool.

Turning this into Java code would be easy if you know what you are doing. 
I used BlueJ becasue it is more beginner friendly and visually pleasing :) https://www.bluej.org/
